## A note about goverance

This project is lead by a group of software engineers passionate about infrastructure. At this point in the project our focus is on delivering a set of software that represents our collective experience in this space - infrastructure, soups to nuts. There is no formal goverance structure in place at this time. As the project takes shape, and there is an organic growth of contributors and end users, we will revisit this topic.

# Local setup guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment. This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to use the command line and a basic understanding of git.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [dev container](https://containers.dev/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

There are two ways to set up your local development environment. Both supported methods are based on [dev container](https://containers.dev/). The first method is a GUI-driven method using VS Code + Remote Containers. The second method is a command-line-driven method using SSH.

### 1. VS Code + Remote Containers (Beginner)

Steps can be found in the [VS Code + Remote Containers](./vs-code.md) guide.

### 2. SSH (Advanced)

Steps can be found in the [SSH + Dev Containers](./ssh.md) guide.
